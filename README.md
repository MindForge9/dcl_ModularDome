# dcl_ModularDome
Modular Dome structure for Decentraland

CSI Domes never brough their concept to mass production, but we can sure leverage the concept for DCL!

Dragon drop the GLBs to a new add-on pack in DCL builder, move and rotate into positions, should all snap together nicely! 300-500 triangles per chunk, so can do a fair number on a 1x1 and loads on larger estates.

Lots of more blocks to come, focusing on elevation/vertical
